Graph QL is quickly becoming the application layer protocol of choice for crud operations, 
its ease of use makes it ideal for quickly spinning up servers for querying data. 
With this project I'd like to build an abstraction layer on top of Graph QL which offers Graph QL as a service; 
to this end I'm trying to build a server that developers can use to significantly streamline the graph ql deployment process. 
For a developer, it should be as easy as uploading a graph QL schema, writing resolvers for the schema, 
and then hitting a deploy button.
